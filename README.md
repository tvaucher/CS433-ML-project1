## How to reproduce our results
We assume that the repository is already downloaded and extracted, that the [data](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/epfl-machine-learning-higgs-2019/dataset_files) is downloaded and extracted in a data/ folder at the root of the program. We further assume that Anaconda is already installed.

### Create the environment
```shell
conda create -n cs433proj1 python=3.7 numpy=1.16 matplotlib
conda activate cs433proj1
```

### Run the code
From the root folder of the project

```shell
python run.py
```
